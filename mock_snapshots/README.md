# Mock snapshots

This folder contains (will contain) mock snapshots used for various tests. They're used to be able to validate functionality without creating snapshots on the fly, as creating a snapshot is a fairly resource-intensive process.

They're mostly bogus data based on real-world scenarios, though a lot of website-specific cases are avoided as reproducing code verbatim in a public git repo feels like the kind of thing that would attract bogus DMCA takedowns.
