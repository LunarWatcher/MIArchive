## Basic guidelines

### Use of generative AI is banned

Generative AI uses training data [based on plagiarism and piracy](https://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/03/libgen-meta-openai/682093/), has [significant environmental costs associated with it](https://mit-genai.pubpub.org/pub/8ulgrckc/release/2?readingCollection=9070dfe7)[^1], and [generates fundamentally insecure code](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-024-10590-1). GenAI is not ethically built, ethical to use, nor safe to use for programming applications. When caught, you will be permanently banned from contributing to the project, and any prior contributions will be checked and potentially reverted.

## Creating issues and pull requests

For bug reports, questions, feature requests, or similar, use [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/LunarWatcher/MIArchive/issues). 

For pull requests, you can open them on either GitHub or Codeberg, but using Codeberg is strongly encouraged. Although all the workflows run on GitHub to avoid throwing traffic at Codeberg's limited CI servers, these running is not a requirement, as I'll usually be doing manual testing anyway. This is not a huge project, and nothing is automatically released without a tag, so the tests running automagically before merging isn't a huge deal.
