## Basic guidelines

### Use of generative AI is banned

Generative AI uses training data [based on plagiarism and piracy](https://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/03/libgen-meta-openai/682093/), has [significant environmental costs associated with it](https://mit-genai.pubpub.org/pub/8ulgrckc/release/2?readingCollection=9070dfe7)[^1], and [generates fundamentally insecure code](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-024-10590-1). GenAI is not ethically built, ethical to use, nor safe to use for programming applications. When caught, you will be permanently banned from contributing to the project, and any prior contributions will be checked and potentially reverted.
